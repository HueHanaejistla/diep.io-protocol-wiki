### Diep.io Protocol Wiki
A wiki dedicated to providing dinformation about the diep.io protocol, and for deciphering the protocol used by the browser game diep.io. This wiki also contains various other info, such as physics (not meant to replace spade squad, but provide more precise formulas and the like), information about m28's API, party links, and other technical information.

All information is hosted on the [wiki](https://github.com/HueHanaejistla/diep.io-protocol-wiki/wiki).

Note: Due to growing controversy on the r/diep.io subreddit and other diep.io communities, I have chosen to not provide any scripts for logging (or other purposes) as there are many people who want to use this information for malicious intent.

## Contributors
While I am currently the only one working on this wiki, I would like to thank several people for helping me to decipher the protocol.
I thank RenegadeBB for helping me on the decompression of compressed packets. <br/>
I thank diep.io for his very helpful insights on the structure of some of the packets when I was starting out. <br/>
I thank shlong, Askeys, and many others for giving me the encouragement to pursue my goals. <br/>
I thank Sh√§dam because he told me I couldn't do anything so I tried harder to prove that I could (lol). <br/>
I thank my fellow dev-friends Cazka, nilpy, Kali, and several others for inspiring me with new ideas. <br/>
And I thank Piotr Dabkowski, CX, FlorianCassayre, and firebolt55439 for their original work on decoding the protocol, which helped to get me on my feet.
