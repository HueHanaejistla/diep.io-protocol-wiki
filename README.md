### Diep.io Protocol Wiki
A wiki dedicated to providing developers with information about the diep.io protocol, and for deciphering the protocol used by the browser game diep.io.

All information is hosted on the [wiki](https://github.com/HueHanaejistla/diep.io-protocol-wiki/wiki).

Note: Due to growing controversy on the r/diep.io subreddit and other diep.io communities, and because a test bot program of mine was recently leaked, no scripts or code will be provided. I apologize for the inconvience that may have been caused by this.

## Contributors
While I am currently the only one working on this wiki, I would like to thank several people for helping me to decipher the protocol.
I thank RenegadeBB for helping me on the decompression of compressed packets. \n
I thank diep.io#7444 for his very helpful insights on the structure of the information packet. \n
I thank shlong, Innocent, Askeys, and many others for giving me the encouragement to pursue my goals. \n
I thank Sh√§dam because he told me I couldn't do anything so I tried harder to prove that I could (lol). \n
And I thank Pola, CX, FlorianCassayre, and firebolt55439 for their original work on decoding the protocol, which helped to get me on my feet.
